# jev-openrouter

> **jev-openrouter** is a fork of [gargpratyush/jev-router](https://github.com/gargpratyush/jev-router)
> that works with an **OpenRouter API key alone**, no TypeSafe account needed (TypeSafe has
> closed signups). It also follows the current Claude Code request shape (upstream stopped
> routing on Claude Code 2.1.2xx) and adds `jev-proxy` for remote-control and IDE sessions.
> See [Jev via OpenRouter](#jev-via-openrouter).

Automatic per-turn model routing for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. Jev sends simple work to
the fast tier and difficult work to the strong tier, while preserving each CLI's native
interface, tools, sessions, permissions, and authentication.

| Command | Interface | Authentication | Routing decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `jev-claude` | Claude Code | Existing `claude login` | Status line |
| `jev-codex` | OpenAI Codex | Existing `codex login` | Commentary line |

Both commands launch the real upstream CLI. Jev only chooses the model for a fresh user turn.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 20.12+ and at least one supported CLI:
[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) or
[OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli).

### 1. npm package

```bash
npm install -g jev-router
echo "JEV_API_KEY=..." > ~/.jev-router.env
```

### 2. Local repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jozso39/jev-openrouter.git
cd jev-openrouter
npm install
npm link
echo "JEV_API_KEY=..." > ~/.jev-router.env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-Content "$HOME\.jev-router.env" "JEV_API_KEY=..."
```

Get a key from [TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai), or use an existing
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key instead (see [Jev via OpenRouter](#jev-via-openrouter)):

```bash
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-..." > ~/.jev-router.env
```

Then launch either interface from any repository:

```bash
jev-claude
jev-codex
```

No Anthropic or OpenAI API key is required when the corresponding CLI is already logged in
with a subscription. Every CLI argument is forwarded:

```bash
jev-claude --resume
jev-claude -p "fix the failing test"
jev-codex resume --last
jev-codex exec "fix the failing test"
```

For a local checkout, `npm link` installs both commands. Without it, run
`node bin/jev-claude.mjs` or `node bin/jev-codex.mjs`.

## Claude Code interface

![Jev Router in the Claude Code model picker](docs/model-picker.png)

`jev-claude` launches Claude Code with **Jev Router** selected in `/model`. Selecting another
model pauses routing; selecting **Jev Router** resumes it.

The injected status line shows the model used for the last turn:

```text
⚡ haiku p=0.98 · my-project · 8% context
⏸ manual Opus 4.6 · my-project · 21% context
```

Claude Code otherwise remains unchanged, including its keybindings, tools, permission prompts,
`/compact`, `/resume`, and session handling. An existing custom `statusLine` is preserved;
set `JEV_NO_STATUSLINE=1` to disable Jev's status line.

The explanation skill is bundled with the npm package and loaded automatically: run
`/jev-explain` in `jev-claude`, or `$jev-explain` in `jev-codex`, to see the factors behind
the last routing decision:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Jev Router                      │
│                                 │
│ Jev request                     │
│ Prompt: explain the router      │
│ Current tier: HAIKU             │
│ Context tokens: 6200            │
│                                 │
│ Jev response                    │
│ Task complexity     0.82        │
│ Reasoning required  0.91        │
│ Tool complexity     0.64        │
│ Context size        0.31        │
│                                 │
│ Recommended tier: SONNET        │
│ Selected model: SONNET          │
│                                 │
│ Confidence: 94%                 │
│ Decision: Jev recommendation    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The report is rendered locally from the exact prompt, System One request, and System One
response saved when routing occurred. Recent decisions are retained per CLI session; invoking
the explanation skill does not ask Jev to score the prompt again.

### Explanation data location

Both `jev-claude` and `jev-codex` keep up to 20 recent routing exchanges in one JSON file per
CLI session under Node.js's operating-system temporary directory:

| Platform | Default location |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%TEMP%\jev-claude\<session-id>.json` |
| macOS | `$TMPDIR/jev-claude/<session-id>.json` (normally under `/var/folders/.../T`) |
| Ubuntu/Linux | `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/jev-claude/<session-id>.json` |

Print the exact directory selected on the current machine with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:path').join(require('node:os').tmpdir(), 'jev-claude'))"
```

Claude filenames use Claude Code's session UUID. Codex filenames use
`codex-<jev-codex-process-id>.json`. These temporary files contain prompt text and Jev's exact
request and response, so they are readable only by you (the directory is created with mode 700 and each
file with 600). Files not updated for 7 days are deleted automatically, and the operating system
may also remove them during normal temporary-file cleanup.

> Choosing a model with `Enter` can save it as Claude Code's default. `jev-claude` restores
> the previous default on exit so `jev-router` cannot break plain `claude`.

## OpenAI Codex interface

![Jev Router in the OpenAI Codex model picker](docs/codex-model-picker.png)

`jev-codex` launches Codex with a temporary **Jev Router** provider and selects `jev-router`.
The native `/model` picker still contains the models available to the account. Selecting a
concrete model pauses routing; selecting **Jev Router** resumes it.

Each fresh decision appears as Codex commentary:

```text
[Jev] routed this turn to gpt-5.6-sol (jev, confidence 0.91).
```

`jev-codex` installs or refreshes the packaged `$jev-explain` skill when it starts, so it is
available from any repository without separate setup.

Codex's footer shows `jev-router` because it displays the selected picker entry,
not the model chosen behind that provider. If Jev is unavailable, the commentary names the
fallback model and explains how to set `JEV_API_KEY`.

## Jev via OpenRouter

OpenRouter serves Jev as [`typesafe/jev-1.13`](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe/jev-1.13) through
the same System One wire format that TypeSafe does, billed to the OpenRouter account at
Jev's list price ($0.042 per million input tokens, output free). A routing decision is
roughly 1k input tokens, so a turn costs about $0.00004 and adds ~0.5 s.

With only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set, `jev-claude` and `jev-codex` route through OpenRouter.
No TypeSafe account is needed. If both an OpenRouter key and a TypeSafe key are present,
TypeSafe is used unless `JEV_PROVIDER=openrouter` is set, because OpenRouter keys are often
in the environment for other tools.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Enables routing through OpenRouter when no TypeSafe key is set. |
| `JEV_PROVIDER` | `openrouter` or `typesafe`; forces the backend when both keys are present. |
| `JEV_MODEL` | Jev model id. Defaults to `typesafe/jev-1.13` on OpenRouter and `jev-latest` on TypeSafe; `~typesafe/jev-latest` tracks OpenRouter's newest release. |
| `JEV_BASE_URL` | API root override for either backend, for a gateway in front of it. |

`JEV_DEBUG=1` logs which backend was selected on the first routed turn, without the key.

## Standalone proxy (`jev-proxy`)

`jev-claude` wraps a `claude` process it starts itself. For Claude Code processes started by
something else — a `claude remote-control` service, an IDE extension, a supervisor — run the
proxy on its own and hand those processes its environment:

```bash
JEV_PROXY_PORT=4517 jev-proxy      # prints the ANTHROPIC_* variables to set
```

Routing policy, logging (`JEV_DEBUG`, `JEV_DUMP`) and credentials are identical to
`jev-claude`. Without `JEV_PROXY_PORT` a free port is chosen and printed. The proxy does not
inject a status line; read decisions from its log or with `jev-explain`.

## How it works

Each command starts a loopback proxy, launches the real CLI, and forwards the CLI's existing
authorization headers without reading, storing, or modifying them.

```text
you -> Claude Code -> jev-claude proxy -> Anthropic
                         |
                         +-> Jev: choose a tier

you -> OpenAI Codex -> jev-codex proxy -> OpenAI
                         |
                         +-> Jev: choose a tier
```

Claude Code uses `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; Codex uses a temporary custom provider with
`requires_openai_auth=true`. Claude and Codex both use `jev-router` as the
routing sentinel.
Any concrete model selected by the user passes through unchanged.

## Routing policy

One Jev call per fresh user turn selects a shared abstract tier:

| Tier | Claude Code default | Codex default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fast | Haiku | `gpt-5.6-luna` |
| Balanced | Sonnet | `gpt-5.6-terra` |
| Strong | Opus | `gpt-5.6-sol` |
| Long | Fable | `gpt-6-astra` |

`src/policy.mjs` then applies these rules:

- explicit requests such as `use opus`, `use luna`, or `use strong` win;
- failure, timeout, or an unrecognised Jev answer keeps the current model;
- low confidence never downgrades and caps upgrades at the balanced tier;
- large conversations refuse downgrades that would waste more prompt-cache work than they save;
- unavailable tiers step upward rather than silently choosing a weaker model;
- the long tier is disabled unless `JEV_ALLOW_FABLE=1`.

Tool-loop continuations keep the tier chosen at the start of the turn. Main conversations and
sub-agents are pinned separately. Routing is fail-open: Jev failure never blocks the CLI.

## Configuration

| Variable | Interface | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JEV_API_KEY` | Both | Enables routing through TypeSafe. `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` also works. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Both | Enables routing through OpenRouter (see [Jev via OpenRouter](#jev-via-openrouter)). |
| `JEV_PROVIDER` / `JEV_MODEL` / `JEV_BASE_URL` | Both | Backend selection and overrides (see [Jev via OpenRouter](#jev-via-openrouter)). |
| `JEV_ALLOW_FABLE` | Both | Enables the opt-in long tier. |
| `JEV_CONTEXT_1M` | Claude | Sends the 1M-context beta on routed Sonnet/Opus/Fable turns, matching Claude Code's `[1m]` variants. Behind the router Claude Code never adds it itself. |
| `JEV_DEBUG` | Both | Logs decisions and rewrites to `~/.jev-claude.log` in interactive sessions. |
| `JEV_DUMP` | Both | Dumps request bodies (and, for Claude, headers with credentials removed) for debugging wire-format changes. |
| `JEV_NO_STATUSLINE` | Claude | Disables the injected Claude status line. |
| `JEV_CODEX_FAST_MODEL` | Codex | Fast model; defaults to `gpt-5.6-luna`. |
| `JEV_CODEX_BALANCED_MODEL` | Codex | Balanced model; defaults to `gpt-5.6-terra`. |
| `JEV_CODEX_STRONG_MODEL` | Codex | Strong model; defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol`. |
| `JEV_CODEX_LONG_MODEL` | Codex | Long model; defaults to `gpt-6-astra`. |

Existing environment variables have highest precedence, followed by `.env` in the launch
directory, `~/.jev-router.env`, and the legacy `~/.jev-claude.env`.

Tier definitions, Jev's question, confidence thresholds, and timeouts live in `src/config.mjs`.
Both launchers send Jev the exact models in the signed-in account's native catalog, so model
versions such as `claude-opus-4-8` and `claude-opus-5` remain separate choices. Static model
ids are used only until the CLI fetches its catalog.

## Compatibility notes

- Claude Code 2.1.2xx appends an environment block as a trailing `system`-role message after
  the user's prompt. The router looks past it to find the user turn; older versions of this
  project saw no user turn at all and left every session on the default tier.
- Claude Code needs schema normalisation for older MCP JSON Schema fields when a custom base
  URL is active.
- Claude request fields unsupported by a routed tier, such as adaptive thinking on Haiku,
  are removed before forwarding.
- Codex's current request format stores tool definitions inside its Responses API input.
- Codex's ChatGPT backend may stream SSE without a `Content-Type` header; the proxy detects
  the event stream from its first frame.
- Codex workspace-specific enterprise origins are internal to its built-in provider and
  cannot be reproduced by a custom provider.

## Development

```bash
npm install
echo "JEV_API_KEY=..." > .env   # or OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...

npm test
node test/live-routing.mjs
node bin/jev-claude.mjs -p "what is 2+2?"
node bin/jev-codex.mjs exec "what is 2+2?"
```

The test suite covers shared policy, both request formats, model rewriting, capability
handling, settings restoration, Codex authentication forwarding, native model-picker
injection, and decision display.

## Limitations

- The user's prompt text is sent to TypeSafe, or to OpenRouter when routing through it, for
  the routing decision. Nothing else is.
- Jev adds latency only to the first request of a turn; tool-loop continuations add none.
- Claude Code and Codex request formats are not public contracts. Use `JEV_DUMP` to diagnose
  upstream changes.
- Developed and tested on Windows against Claude Code v2.1.101 and OpenAI Codex v0.154.0.
  The OpenRouter backend and the trailing-environment-message fix were tested on Linux
  (arm64) against Claude Code v2.1.277.
